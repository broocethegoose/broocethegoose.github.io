### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

Lab 3, part 2 was probably one of my favorites even though it was a lab we started on really early in the year when school first started. I had no prior knowledge of coding and same goes for my partner so we both went into the school year with a fresh start. This assignment required us to make a sandwich order by following a specific format. We were both so lost and it was really confusing at the start but this assignment really tested our problem solving skills. In the end we accomplished what was asked of us in the assignment and what sparked my interest in coding.  

* Lab 4

Lab 4, part 1 was a lab that required us to make a conversion between the difference of days so we had to create the logic to a calculator that would tell the difference between 2 dates when the user enters it in. At the point in time we had switched partners from our previous assignments and I had a totally new person to work with. This assignment was so difficult to the point where I had to keep asking the TA for help because my code had so many errors or the input wasn’t giving the correct output. I can tell the frustration on the TA’s face as a result from my partner and I asking for assistance so many times. We were so scared to ask for help again so we tried our best to figure it out ourselves for the rest of the class time and referred to our notes. When our code finally worked we felt so relieved and the satisfaction on our faces was indescribable.  

* Lab 6

Lab 6, part 1 was the most fun lab we had to code because we had to create a visual pattern file that portrays an image using dashes and lines. The code wasn’t long but we just couldn’t seem to figure out why our code didn’t portray the correct image. At first we got the first part of the pattern right but it didn’t mirror the other half of the image that we were supposed to have. I recalled my professor warning us about a possible infinite loop occurring if we ran a specific command. Funny thing was my partner and I got to see that infinite loop on our screen and it was hilarious because it kept going on and on to where the TA shut our computer off. It was just funny how terrible we were at working together and using our brains to finish the assignment.
